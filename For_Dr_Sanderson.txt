Dear Roy, 

I've created two seperate folders contining code for my image classification model:

1) Custom_image_classification:
	Customisable model that you can use to create a model for any species of animal 

2) Vincent's Project:
	A largely unaltered vesion of my final project, it may not fully work due to 		the file structure used in some of the scripts.

Further instructions are in the respective folders. 

Vincent,
